# YanusLIVE

## Description
Yanus Live is a live streaming software based on innovative facial motion capture technology. The program can capture and adjust an actor's facial expressions in real-time and reflect that data directly into the live stream. (Using Yanus CAM and dedicated hardware provides much more stable operation.)

Yanus LIVE allows you to monitor actors' faces and motion capture characters in real-time.
Neutral calibration and convenient retargeting functions facilitate quick setup at the shooting sites.

Yanus LIVE can connect to external Unreal Engine projects by transmitting motion capture results through two channels of LiveLink.
You can also export data files compatible with the ARKit standard and use them as animation data in other programs, such as Yanus ReTARGET.

## Installation
Yanus_LIVE is currently distributed as a compressed file.
Unzip the file and run Yanus_LIVE.exe. The path for unzipping should only be in English. 
Please avoid desktop, user path, or overly deep directories.


## Initial Setup
The program uses setttings_gui.ini and settings_user.ini as configuration files.
Upon the first launch, the necessary relative paths for the initial execution are automatically updated.

If the installation folder location changes after the initial launch, or if the executable and configuration files are patched, modify the settings_gui.ini file by changing the last line to main_first_run=true and then run Yanus_LIVE.exe to reset the settings.

## Requirements
We recommend PC specifications that can comfortably run Unreal Engine. 
The development was carried out on a 13th generation i9 PC, 
but the minimum specifications are still being confirmed.

## License Authorization

1. Start the program.
