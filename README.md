# YanusLIVE

## Description
Yanus Live is a live streaming software based on innovative facial motion capture technology. The program can capture and adjust an actor's facial expressions in real-time and reflect that data directly into the live stream. (Using Yanus CAM and dedicated hardware provides much more stable operation.)

Yanus LIVE allows you to monitor actors' faces and motion capture characters in real-time.
Neutral calibration and convenient retargeting functions facilitate quick setup at the shooting sites.

Yanus LIVE can connect to external Unreal Engine projects by transmitting motion capture results through two channels of LiveLink.
You can also export data files compatible with the ARKit standard and use them as animation data in other programs, such as Yanus ReTARGET.

## Installation
Yanus_LIVE is currently distributed as a compressed file.
Unzip the file and run Yanus_LIVE_<version>.exe. The path for unzipping should only be in English. 
Please avoid desktop, user path, or overly deep directories.

## Initial Setup
When initially installing, it is recommended to separately download and install the demo videos and the demo character package files built in Unreal Engine or Unity

Here are examples of the paths:
D:/YanusSTUDIO/YanusLIVE/demo
D:/YanusSTUDIO/YanusLIVE/package/Bora
D:/YanusSTUDIO/YanusLIVE/YanusLIVE_v1.2.5

### Demo Character Package
After running YanusLIVE, you need to register the executable file path of the demo Character package in the Remote tab under File > Settings.

For the first run of the demo character package, it might not be imported into YanusLIVE due to security permissions. Please close and restart the character mode. Additionally, if Unreal Engine is not installed on the PC, there is a process to install other necessary programs.

## Requirements
We recommend PC specifications that can comfortably run Unreal Engine. 
For stable performance at 60Hz in real-time, we recommend an Intel 13th generation i9 PC or higher.
On lower-end PCs, it is optimized to output as many frames as possible with minimal delay according to the computer's performance.
